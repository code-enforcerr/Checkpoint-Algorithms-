Algorithm: Sentence Analysis

Input: A sentence ending with a period (.)
Output: Length of the sentence, number of words, number of vowels

1. Initialize three counters:
   - length_counter to count characters in the sentence
   - word_counter to count words separated by spaces
   - vowel_counter to count vowels (a, e, i, o, u)

2. Read the input sentence character by character until the period (.) is encountered:
   a. Increment length_counter for each character read.
   b. If the character is a space (' '), increment word_counter to count words.
   c. Check if the character is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' or uppercase variants):
      - Increment vowel_counter if the character is a vowel.

3. After reaching the period (.), include it in the length count and end the input reading.

4. Output the following results:
   - Total length of the sentence (including spaces and the period).
   - Number of words counted based on spaces.
   - Number of vowels found within the sentence.

5. End.

Example:
Input: "Hello, how are you today."
Output:
- Sentence Length: 24
- Number of Words: 5
- Number of Vowels: 7
